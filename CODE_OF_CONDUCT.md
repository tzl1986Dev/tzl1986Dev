## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Representation of the project can happen in a lot of ways and is not a binary status: For example, contacting an upstream on behalf of the project means representing that project to a certain degree.

Moreover, we expect community members to maintain a minimum standard of human decency at all times. Open harassment, discrimination or other hateful behavior involving community members is always inacceptable.
